/**
 * RunSolver.java
 *
 * Created for CSC115 201605 Assignment four.
 * Modified from a previous version created by M. Zastre.
 * Current modification: B. Bultena
 *
 * This top-level program takes the name of a file containing maze
 * information, and then reads this into a integers and an array
 * of strings. The Maze object is instantiated, solve() called on it
 * and the results (if any) are output on the console.
 *
 * This code will not compile until there is an implementation of
 * the Maze.java class that has at least a constructor and a
 * bare-bones implementation of solve() (i.e., bare-bones means that
 * the method simply returns null).

	 * Runs an external test of the Maze class.

	 * 	<ol>
	 *	<li> int int</li>
	 *	<li> int int</li>

	 *	<li> maze row of spaces and asterisks.</li>
	 * 	<li> repeat similar lines as many times as required.</li>
	 *	</ol>
	 * The first line contains the number of rows and the number of columns.
	 * The second line contains the cell number of the entrance to the maze.
	 * The third line contains the cell number of the exit from the maze.
	 * Subsequent lines contain equal length strings of asterisks and spaces,
	 *	an asterisk representing a wall and a space representing a free cell.
